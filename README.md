# Pet-Planetoid

This is a fully responsive and functional web application where you can add a post with image of your pet and like and comments to these posts as well.

You can experience routing and navigation by react router, again a protected route which you can not access without sigin. and again you have to verify your email for sign in . in the protected route you can create a post or view others posts and make likes and comments to them . Again you can visit their profile to see their posts and personal info the have provided.

I have used react and tailwind for front end and express and mongodb for both server and database.
Used firebase for authentication.React-querry for fetch and refetching data from the server.
